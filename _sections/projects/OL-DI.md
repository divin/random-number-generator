This is another side project I'm working on in my free time with the code name OL-DI. I try to make my own version of the popular but expensive [OP-1 by Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1). I'm still in the prototyping stage and don't have anything good looking or good working yet. As soon as I reach a stage which is worth showing I'll update this page and probably put some updates to my social media platforms. In the mean time stay tuned! ðŸ“»
