I'm currently developing a little first person game as side project on my own in [Godot](https://godotengine.org). My dream is to create and publish games in the future, maybe as solo developer or maybe in a team. The game which I develop is in his early stages and the codename of the project is "Space Odyssey". I can't publish much more information yet but as soon as the game is show worthy I'll publish more updates on different social media platforms. This description will also be updated then.

My plan is to release the game on Steam but a release date is not fixed yet. I think it will need roughly a year as I'm currently doing my master thesis at the same time and don't have much free time. But who knows maybe everything goes faster, or slower, than expected.
