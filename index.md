# Random Number Generator 

This small prototype, created with [Godot](https://godotengine.org), shows how to generate reproducible random numbers for the raffle of My Basic Income. With a given seed, the draw can be reproduced by any user, making the whole draw process more open to all. You can try it out below (WARNING: the experience is best on desktop).
